I have a test server consist of an Intel NUC mini pc. It's running Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS Server/minimal headless install.
It's serving: 

1. an nginx webserver, to host a basic index page through virtual path on the server.
2. samba share serving the local network at home
3. cups (print server) for a local printer
4. freedns updater script, so that the server can be accessed from anywhere through the internet
5. a pi-hole DNS server that provide network-wide ad blocking to the home network
6. a fail2ban setup to protect the webserver and the server itself
